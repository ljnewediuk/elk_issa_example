# Elk iSSA Example

# Example demonstrating issue with lack of variation in random effects

SSF models to test for density-dependent selection of habitat by elk

Covariates: Agricultural land (Ag); coniferous forest (Conifer); mixed forest (MW); elk density (D_St)

Plot shows fixed effects and confidence intervals (black dots and bars) with individual random effects shown by coloured points. The individuals are coloured by whether they have used steps in each covariate (used = at least some used steps in covariate; one_used = for interactions, at least some used steps on one of the covariates; not_used = no used steps in covariate).
