# Elk iSSA Example

# Example demonstrating issue with lack of variation in random effects

SSF models to test for density-dependent selection of habitat by elk

Covariates: Agricultural land (Ag); coniferous forest (Conifer); mixed forest (MW); elk density (D_St)

Plot shows fixed effects and confidence intervals (black dots and bars) with individual random effects shown by coloured points. The individuals are coloured by whether they have non-zero used steps in each covariate (used = at least some non-zero used steps in covariate; one_used = for interactions, at least some non-zero used steps in one of the covariates; not_used = all used steps in covariate are zero).
